<h3>What is considered a legitimate MC?</h3>
<p>Though <a href="https://mc.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mc.gov.sg</a> is
the official platform, many other digital providers exist. These MCs are
all considered legitimate as long as they are issued by SMC-registered
doctors.</p>
<p>As the MC is computer-generated, the doctor’s wet-ink signature is not
required. Instead, the doctor’s name and MCR number are stated on our DigiMCs.</p>
<h3>How do I verify that a DigiMC is authentic?</h3>
<p>For MCs issued through our platform, ensure that the URL is from the
<a href="http://mc.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mc.gov.sg</a>domain. This guarantees that the MC has not been been tampered
with, and has been issued by a doctor.</p>
<p>For DigiMCs that have been printed or downloaded, you will find a link
and QR code at the bottom of the MC. You may enter the link into a web
browser or scan the QR code to check if the downloaded version corresponds
to the original online MC.</p>
<h3>Do I need to retain the MC and for how long?</h3>
<p>There is no stipulated retention period for MCs and some companies do
not retain MCs. You may retain it according to your company’s policy for
audit purposes.</p>
<h3>Does the MC link expire?</h3>
<p>No. The MC link does not expire as some employers may audit MCs down the
road.</p>
<h3>If my employees pass me a paper MC, can I request for a DigiMC?</h3>
<p>Not all healthcare institutions issue DigiMCs today and for institutions
which do, not all of their patients will receive the DigiMC. Some patients
may request for a paper MC instead (e.g. if they left their phones at home),
and employers should continue to accept paper MCs.</p>
<h3>Some of my staff currently take only part of the full-day MC which they received and their supervisors are required to sign on it to verify that they had only taken part of the MC. How can I do this with DigiMC?</h3>
<p>In these specific situations, you may consider an alternative workflow
such as having the supervisor to indicate in an email to HR, with the DigiMC
link, that the staff had only taken part of the MC. If required, the DigiMC
may also be printed to be signed on as per a paper MC.</p>
<h3>Can foreign workers receive DigiMC?</h3>
<p>Yes. DigiMCs can be issued to anyone.</p>
<h3>I do not have an IT system to manage MC submissions. How should I use DigiMC?</h3>
<p>If you just need to sight the MC, you can request your employees to forward
the DigiMC link to you via any communication channel (e.g. WhatsApp, SMS,
email). If you need to retain the MCs, you may request the links from your
employees and store the links in an excel sheet.</p>
<h3>What if my current system requires an attachment?</h3>
<p>In the long run, DigiMC should be saved as a link rather than an attachment
as its authenticity comes from being viewed online at the mc.gov.sg domain.
If your system has a comments field, your employees may insert the DigiMC
link into the field instead. If your system does not have a comments field,
DigiMC can be downloaded and saved as a PDF or print screen to be uploaded
as an attachment. To download the MC, right click and select the print
option etc.</p>
<h3>Can DigiMC be integrated with my HR IT system?</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding that MCs can only be submitted to employers through patients’
consent, we are open to exploring integrating with HR systems if your needs
match our current available API and integration services provided. Please
contact us at <a href="mailto:mc@open.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mc@open.gov.sg</a> to
indicate your interest.</p>
