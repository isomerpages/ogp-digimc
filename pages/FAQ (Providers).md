<h3>Why should I issue digital MCs?</h3>
<p>Over the past 5 years, digital MCs have replaced hardcopies as the new
norm. Digitisation eliminates the need for physical storage, allows medical
records to remain in-sync, and reduces time spent on administrative tasks
with patients.</p>
<p>Additionally, patients typically prefer digital MCs for ease of submitting
it to their employer or school. When we conducted a pilot from Apr - Jul
2019, 95% of 179 patients agree to the question "On the whole I'm satisfied
with using DigiMC", with reasons including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Able to easily submit MC to more than 1 person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will not forget to bring MC back to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will not lose it as long as I have the link</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can send it immediately on the same day I visit doctor</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>I already issue MCs digitally. What's different about DigiMC?</h3>
<p>Though <a href="https://mc.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mc.gov.sg</a> is
the official platform, many other digital providers exist. These MCs are
all considered legitimate as long as they are issued by SMC-registered
doctors.</p>
<p>However, most solutions send the MC to patients as an image (PDF, JPG).
When patients forward the image to their employers, it may be difficult
to ascertain if the image is authentic, or has been tampered with. For
less-established MC providers, employers may also not recognise the document
format, leading to disputes around legitimacy.</p>
<p>DigiMCs cannot be forged, because they are hosted directly at the <a href="https://mc.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mc.gov.sg</a> domain.
This guarantees that the information is original as per your issuance.
Should patients download or print the document, it contains a QR code that
allows employers to verify the original, online version.</p>

<h3>As a GP, how can I start using DigiMC?</h3>
<p>At the moment, we do not allow doctors to issue DigiMCs directly. Instead,
we have worked with several major clinic management systems and telemedicine
systems, which provide the linkage within your CMS workflow.</p>
<p>Ask your CMS provider if they provide DigiMC integration!</p>
<h3>As a CMS operator, how can I integrate with DigiMC?</h3>
<p>We are happy to integrate with private providers: we already issue MCs
on behalf of ~700 clinics island-wide.</p>
<p>We do not charge for usage, as we view digital MCs as a public good in
Singapore. The API specs are very simple - most partners have managed to
get the integration running within a few weeks or months.</p>
