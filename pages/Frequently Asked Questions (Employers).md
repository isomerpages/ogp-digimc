### What is considered a legitimate MC?

MCs are legitimate as long as they are issued by SMC-registered doctors. As the MC is a computer-generated MC, the doctor’s signature is not required. The doctor’s name and MCR number are stated on the DigiMC. To further cement its authenticity, ensure that the digital MC is issued from the ‘https://mc.gov.sg’ domain.

### How do I verify that the DigiMC is authentic if I receive a downloaded version of the MC?

The DigiMC link and QR code is printed at the bottom of the MC. You may enter the link into a web browser or scan the QR code to check if the downloaded version corresponds to the online MC.

### Do I need to retain the MC and for how long?

There is no stipulated retention period for MCs and some companies do not retain MCs. You may retain it according to your company’s policy for audit purposes.

### Does the MC link expire?

No. The MC link does not expire as some employers may audit MCs down the road.

### If my employees pass me a paper MC, can I request for a DigiMC?

Not all healthcare institutions issue DigiMCs today and for institutions which do, not all of their patients will receive the DigiMC. Some patients may request for a paper MC instead (e.g. if they left their phones at home), and employers should continue to accept paper MCs.

### Some of my staff currently take only part of the full-day MC which they received and their supervisors are required to sign on it to verify that they had only taken part of the MC. How can I do this with DigiMC?

In these specific situations, you may consider an alternative workflow such as having the supervisor to indicate in an email to HR, with the DigiMC link, that the staff had only taken part of the MC. If required, the DigiMC may also be printed to be signed on as per a paper MC.

### Can foreign workers receive DigiMC?

Yes. Foreigners who enter their mobile numbers with their country code into the system will be able to receive DigiMC via SMS. If your foreign workers do not have phones or data plans or prefer not to receive a DigiMC, they may still request a paper MC from the doctor.

### I do not have an IT system to manage MC submissions. How should I use DigiMC?

If you just need to sight the MC, you can request your employees to forward the DigiMC link to you via any communication channel (e.g. WhatsApp, SMS, email). If you need to retain the MCs, you may request the links from your employees and store the links in an excel sheet.

### What if my current system requires an attachment?

In the long run, DigiMC should be saved as a link rather than an attachment as its authenticity comes from being viewed online at the mc.gov.sg domain. If your system has a comments field, your employees may insert the DigiMC link into the field instead. If your system does not have a comments field, DigiMC can be downloaded and saved as a PDF or print screen to be uploaded as an attachment. To download the MC, right click and select the print option etc.

### Can DigiMC be integrated with my HR IT system?

Notwithstanding that MCs can only be submitted to employers through patients’ consent, we are open to exploring integrating with HR systems. Please contact us through our support form to indicate your interest.

### My company is under an insurance panel of clinics with private general practitioners (GPs). Can they also issue DigiMC?

A number of GPs have already onboarded to DigiMC. If the clinics in your company's panel do not currently use it, you may indicate the specific insurance panel your company is using via the support form so that we may reach out to them to explore their usage of DigiMC.
