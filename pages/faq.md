### What are digital MCs?

A digital medical certificate (MC) is the online version of a paper medical certificate (MC). Digital MC can be accessed via a unique link under the main mc.gov.sg domain, for example, <https://www.mc.gov.sg/mc/abc12345678>.

### Why are we digitalising MCs?

It can be inconvenient to submit a paper MC to the human resource department or supervisor. We seek to ease this process by allowing employees to submit MC via an SMS containing the MC link. You no longer need to worry about misplacing paper MC or having to request for a replacement. It is also more sustainable as using less paper saves our environment! 

When we conducted a pilot from Apr - Jul 2019, 95% of 179 patients agree to the question "On the whole I'm satisfied with using DigiMC", with reasons including:
- Able to easily submit MC to more than 1 person
- Will not forget to bring MC back to work
- Will not lose it as long as I have the link
- Can send it immediately on the same day I visit doctor 

### When will digital MCs be made available?

Digital MC will be made available to all SingHealth institutions by early 2020.

### Can I still get a paper MC if I want to?

Paper MC will still be available on request.

### Can my employer or other people access my digital MC without my consent?

Only you will receive the SMS containing your digital MC link. You may choose to forward it to your employer or relevant parties. Please ensure that your mobile number is updated with the healthcare institution in order to receive the SMS.

### There is no doctor’s signature on the digital MC. How do I prove that the digital MC is authentic?

As the digital MC is a computer-generated MC, the doctor’s signature is not required. The doctor’s signature is in the form of his/her name in block letters on the digital MC together with the doctor’s MCR number. To further cement its authenticity, ensure that the digital MC is issued from the <https://www.mc.gov.sg> domain. If you need further clarification, please call the issuing healthcare institution.

### What if my employer does not recognise my digital MC?

You may inform them to check out [FAQ for employers](/employer-faq).

### What if I lose my digital MC?

You will need to request the healthcare institution to issue the paper MC. We encourage you not to delete your DigiMC SMS, and save the link, to prevent such a situation.

### Is there a way I can access all DigiMCs through the mc.gov.sg website?

No. Each DigiMC has a unique link and can only be accessed via that link which has been sent to you via SMS. All your DigiMCs will appear in the same SMS conversation and you can refer to that SMS conversation to find a previous DigiMC.

### What if I do not receive my SMS link to the digital MC after seeing the doctor?

Please ensure that the mobile number that you have provided to the healthcare institution is updated. Alternatively, you may complete our support form, and we will follow up with your request promptly.

### I have received the SMS but the URL does not work. Who can I contact for help?

You may complete our support form, and we will follow up on your request promptly. While waiting for our response, please check the internet connection, or test the link on another internet-enabled device.

### Is there an option to send to my email address instead?

As most healthcare institutions request for the patient’s phone number during the registration process, but not their email address, you may share the link through email to yourself.

### Is DigiMC recognised for insurance claims?

If your insurers require an MC for insurance claims to be made, DigiMC is an authentic MC and should be recognised by them. You may direct them to this website or contact us via the support form if they have further clarifications about DigiMC. For other clarifications on other medical records or documents, please contact the healthcare institution you visited instead.

### What types of leave can healthcare institutions issue DigiMC for?

DigiMC can be issued for the following leave types: Hospitalisation leave, Outpatient sick leave, Maternity leave, Sterilisation leave, Time chit.
